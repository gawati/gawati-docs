The reason we have this as a distinct service and a recommendation that it be run only on the host computer of the user signing the document is for security and safety reasons. This ensures the private key is stored only on the host signing the document, and the only service interaction where the private key leaves the host is via an encrpted secure connection with the package signature service.
