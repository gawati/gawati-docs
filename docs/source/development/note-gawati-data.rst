**What are gawati-data and gw-data about ?**: 

The *gw-data* package defined the collection in the XML database where all the raw XML documents are held. This is never directly accessible externally.  The *Gawati Data* package provides REST based services to access the XML documents. 
So in a nutshell,  *gw-data* is the data, and *gawati-data* is the software to access the data.
